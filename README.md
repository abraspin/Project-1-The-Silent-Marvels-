# UTA-FSF Project 1 - SHAKR App
 A cocktail generator web-app that uses theCocktailDB.com and Google Maps API to render cocktail recipes based on user-submitted ingredients on-hand.


### This repository contains the code files for the 1st project assignment for the UT-Austin Coding Bootcamp.

## Project Assignment
- Design, build, and deploy a client-side web application using GitHub Pages  
- Use third-party APIs to dynamically render an interactive web page  
- Practice applied agile software development, git branching work flow, and professional presentation  

## SHAKR
>AS a person who doesn't know which drink to make
>I WANT to know which mixed drinks I already have the ingredients for 
>SO THAT I can make a tasty beverage at home  

>AS an owner of random drink ingredients  
>I WANT to be shown detailed recipes and instructions  
>SO THAT I can succesfully make the drinks myself.  

>AS a person with nothing to drink at home  
>I WANT to be shown nearby bars and grocery stores  
>SO THAT I can imbibe beyond my at-home ingredient constraints
